# Queue system incident report

## Date and time

- **Incident Start:** 2025-02-05 02:32 UTC
- **Incident End:** 2025-02-05 03:03 UTC

## Summary

On February 5, 2025, Appwrite experienced a service disruption affecting our queue system and API services. The incident lasted approximately 31 minutes, during which some users experienced delays in job processing and temporary API access issues.

## Incident details

### Initial detection

Our monitoring systems detected anomalies in our queue processing system at 02:32 UTC. Our incident response team was immediately notified and began investigation.

### Affected components

- Queue processing system
- Background job processing
- API services
- Console access

### User impact

- Temporary disruption to background job processing
- Brief periods of API instability
- Delayed processing of queued operations
- Some users experienced temporary access issues to the console

## Root cause analysis

### Preliminary findings

Initial investigation revealed resource constraints in our queue processing infrastructure, which began affecting related services.

### Investigation

Our team conducted a thorough investigation of the queue processing systems and identified resource exhaustion as the primary concern. We observed a significant increase in queued jobs that contributed to the system strain.

### Root cause

The incident was caused by resource exhaustion in our queue infrastructure. A significant increase in queued jobs over several hours led to system pressure, ultimately affecting the stability of related services.

## Resolution and recovery

### Immediate actions

1. Identified affected system components
2. Implemented infrastructure scaling measures
3. Rebalanced system workload
4. Optimized processing capacity
5. Monitored system recovery

### Resolution

Service restoration was achieved through a coordinated response that included infrastructure scaling, workload rebalancing, and system optimization. All services were fully restored by 03:03 UTC.

## Lessons learned

### What went well

1. Rapid incident detection and response
2. Effective team coordination
3. Systematic approach to resolution

### What can be improved

1. Enhanced early warning systems
2. More proactive resource monitoring
3. Improved service resilience
4. Faster deployment of critical system updates - A planned improvement that would have prevented API impact during queue system incidents was still in development
5. Better service isolation

### Action items

1. Enhance monitoring and alerting systems
2. Implement improved auto-scaling capabilities
3. Accelerate planned system resilience updates
4. Optimize resource allocation strategies
5. Strengthen service isolation mechanisms
